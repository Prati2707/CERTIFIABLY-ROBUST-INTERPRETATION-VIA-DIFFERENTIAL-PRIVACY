CERTIFIABLY ROBUST INTERPRETATION VIA DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY

Welcome!! this repository is designed to demonstrate my proficiency in machine learning concepts and AI applications, tailored for recruiters and hiring managers looking for talented candidates in the Data Science field.

This project explores into the intersection of robust interpretation and differential privacy within the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). It focuses on creating AI systems that are not only decision-effective but also transparent and protective of individual privacy. The scope encompasses conducting experiments across various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designs, integrating differential privacy into their training.
